						<p class="fz-20 w-768">
							We are inspired by the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and the exciting changes happening within it. As experts work to improve and advance AI, a
							new focus has emerged on the
							importance of data.
						</p>
						<p class="fz-20 w-768">
							AI is made up of two main components: the model and the data. The models are like tools that help computers understand information, while the data is
							what the models analyze. In
							the past, most AI developers focused on perfecting their models, known as model-centric AI. This approach led to advanced machine learning systems, but
							it also had limitations.
						</p>
						<p class="fz-20 w-768">
							Recently, there has been a shift towards a data-centric approach to AI. This means researchers are now placing greater importance on the quality of the
							data used in AI models. AI
							trailblazer Andrew Ng defines this approach as "systematically engineering the data needed to build a successful AI system." By focusing on the data,
							researchers are working to
							improve the performance of AI models and help bring us closer to finding a cure for childhood cancer.

									Here are a few ways in which AI is important in our medical research:
								</b>
							</span>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<ul class="disk-list">
						<li>
							<b>Data analysis:</b> Medical research generates a vast amount of data, including patient records, clinical trial results, and genetic information. AI
							algorithms can analyze this data
							quickly and accurately, uncovering patterns and trends that might not be immediately apparent to humans. This can help researchers identify risk factors
							for diseases, develop new
							treatments, and predict the likelihood of certain health outcomes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Diagnosis and treatment:</b> AI algorithms can analyze patient data and help doctors make more accurate diagnoses. For example, AI can analyze
							medical
							images and identify abnormalities
							that might not be visible to the human eye. This can help doctors identify diseases in the early stages, when they are most treatable. AI can also help
							doctors identify the most
							appropriate treatment options for individual patients based on their unique characteristics and medical history.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Drug development:</b> AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data from chemical compounds and identify those with the most potential for use in
							new
							drugs. This can help speed up
							the drug development process, which can take years or even decades using traditional methods.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Clinical trials:</b> AI can be used to identify potential candidates for clinical trials and monitor their progress. This can help researchers enroll
							more
							representative groups of
							patients, which can lead to more accurate results. AI can also help researchers identify trends and patterns in the data collected during clinical
							trials, allowing them to make
							more informed decisions about which treatments are most effective.
