						<p>
							Once upon a time, in a world where childhood cancer rates were alarmingly high, a family fighting pediatric cancer came together to form a charity
							dedicated to finding a cure. This
							charity, known as the "<span><b>The Purple Society</b></span>," was driven by a single mission: <b>to end the suffering of children and their families
								affected by cancer.</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Nitalia Conti, the 12-year-old visionary founder, saw the disparity in resources available to children and took action. She understood the importance of
							family and wanted to ensure
							that no one ever had to make these tough decisions alone. Nitalia’s sisters and her parents, who were determined to support her vision, sprung into
							action and setup the 501(c)3
							Foundation that would connect families with the information they needed to make informed decisions about their child's treatment options. And that was
							just the beginning!
						</p>
						<p>
							Nitalia and her family brought together a team of scientists, doctors, and advocates who had all been personally impacted by cancer. Nitalia recognized
							the need for better access
							to cutting-edge research technology, as well as the power of community support and hope in times of struggle.
						</p>
						<p>
							By offering both, <span><b>The Purple Society</b></span> is
							setting the stage for a
							brighter future for ALL families facing childhood cancer.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>
							The organization's commitment to staying at the forefront of research and providing a supportive network for families speaks to a higher purpose, one
							that transcends the
							limitations of the present and reaches towards a better tomorrow.
						</p>
						<p>
							After working for <b>over a decade</b>, it became a ray of hope for families affected by cancer. Every step forward in their research was a step closer
							to
							Nitalia's dream of a world free
							of childhood cancer. Despite Nitalia's passing in 2011, the organization continues to carry on her legacy, working tirelessly to fulfill her vision of a
							world where no child has to
							suffer the devastating effects of cancer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nitalia's story serves as a reminder that each one of us has the power to bring about positive change in the world, regardless of age. She always said
							“<b>One Person CAN Make A Difference</b>”!
						</p>
						<p>
							Though she may have left us, her spirit lives on in the ongoing efforts of <span><b>The Purple Society</b></span>. Let us follow in Nitalia's footsteps
							and
							work towards creating a world
							where every child has the opportunity to live a healthy and fulfilling life.
						</p>
						<p>

									<i>Please Help Us Fulfill Nitalia’s Dream!</i>
