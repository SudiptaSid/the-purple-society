								At our childhood cancer charity, we believe that every child is a precious and unique individual, deserving of love and compassion. No child should
								have
								to endure the pain and
								suffering of cancer, and it is our mission to do everything in our power to support and care for these brave and resilient young individuals.
							</p>
							<p>
								We understand that childhood cancer is a heartbreaking and difficult journey, not just for the child, but for the entire family. That is why we are
								dedicated to providing not only
								medical care, but also emotional support and financial assistance to help families cope with the challenges of cancer treatment.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that no family should have to face the burden of cancer alone, and it is our goal to be a constant source of love, hope, and support for
								children and families affected
								by this devastating disease.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are committed to bringing light and healing to the lives of those we serve, and to spreading love and compassion to all those affected by
								childhood
								cancer.

							<h6>We are hyper-focused on the following:</h6>
							<ul class="number-list">
								<li>
									Increase funding for childhood cancer research: One of the biggest challenges in the fight against childhood cancer is the lack of funding and
									resources dedicated to research. By increasing funding, we can accelerate the pace of progress and bring us closer to finding more effective
									treatments and a cure.
								</li>
								<li>
									Improve access to quality care: Not all children have access to the best possible cancer care, and this can significantly impact their chances
									of
									survival. We aim to improve access
									to high-quality care for all children with cancer, regardless of their location or financial circumstances.
								</li>
								<li>
									Develop more targeted and personalized treatments: Many current cancer treatments are toxic and can have serious side effects. We aim to develop
									more targeted and personalized
									treatments that are less toxic and more effective at killing cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells.
								</li>
								<li>
									Support families through the cancer journey: Cancer affects the entire family, not just the child with the disease. We aim to provide a range of
									supportive services to help
									families cope with the emotional and practical challenges of cancer treatment.
								</li>
								<li>
									Promote awareness and understanding of childhood cancer: Childhood cancer is often misunderstood, and we aim to increase awareness and
									understanding
									of the disease among the
									general public.
								</li>
								<li>
									Improve survival rates: Despite progress in recent years, the survival rates for some types of childhood cancer are still unacceptably low. We
									aim
									to improve survival rates for all
									types of childhood cancer.
								</li>
								<li>
									Reduce the long-term effects of cancer treatment: Many cancer treatments can have long-term effects on a child's physical and emotional
									well-being.
									We aim to reduce these effects
									by developing less toxic treatments and providing support to children and families during and after treatment.
								</li>
								<li>
									Support children and families through end-of-life care: For some children with cancer, a cure may not be possible. We aim to provide
									compassionate
									and supportive end-of-life care
									to children and their families.
								</li>
								<li>
									Advocate for children with cancer: We aim to be a powerful voice for children with cancer and their families, advocating for their rights and
									needs
									at the local, national, and
									international level.
								</li>
								<li>
									Work towards a world without childhood cancer: Our ultimate goal is to find a cure for childhood cancer and create a world where no child has to
									suffer from this devastating
									disease.
								</li>
